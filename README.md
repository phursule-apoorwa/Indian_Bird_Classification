# Indian_Bird_Classification

This project explores the effectiveness of EfficientNet models B0 to B7 for bird classification. EfficientNet models are designed using a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the network's depth, width, and resolution. By leveraging transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques, we aim to harness the power of these pre-trained models to classify bird species accurately.

The comparative analysis showed that the EfficientNetB0 model outperformed other models, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.45% with a minimal loss of just 0.01712. This superior performance underscores the effectiveness of the EfficientNet architecture in handling the complexities of the dataset and making accurate predictions.

The code uploaded is only for the B0 model, to run other models(B1-B7) change the name of the model from B0 to the respective model you would like to run at line #260.
