# Indian_Bird_Classification

This project explores the effectiveness of EfficientNet models B0 to B7 for bird classification. EfficientNet models are designed using a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the network's depth, width, and resolution. By leveraging transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques, we aim to harness the power of these pre-trained models to classify bird species accurately.

The comparative analysis showed that the EfficientNetB0 model outperformed other models, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.45% with a minimal loss of just 0.01712. This superior performance underscores the effectiveness of the EfficientNet architecture in handling the complexities of the dataset and making accurate predictions.
